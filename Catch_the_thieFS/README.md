# Catch the theiFS

## Description

Curses visualisation of a sandbox/madeup file system.
There will be some thief running around the file system that they have to chase after by using cd syntax.
Each stage will have a different character limit that will encourage them to think of creative solutions.

## Solution

// TODO: Insert an example walkthrough

## Learning Outcome

The idea is to gamify the concept in order to allow them to develop familiarity of cd, since shit like ~ or .. can be quite confusing.
The game is spsed to incentivise them to learn these tricks by heart so they can chase the thief faster.

Concepts:
* Full path (/a/b/c)
* Relative path (a/b)
* Relative* (../../c)

## Flag

`omu{robb@crime:~$ cd /go/to/jail}`
